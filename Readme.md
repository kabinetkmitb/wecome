# We-Come Monorepo

This is a monorepo for wecome KM ITB. The website is built with rust as a primary programming language. The frontend stacks is using [yew](https://yew.rs), a website framework that has a similar design pattern as react. The backend service is built by [web actix](https://actix.rs) and [diesel](https://diesel.rs), also using [prisma](http://prisma.io/) with the javascript client for handling the automigration and seeding.

## Why Rust?

> Rust is good dawggggggg

Since yew will build target will be compiled as wasm file which is known faster than using plain javascript provided development is done with the right tools and framework. Also, just for a fun exploration project. Ah yes, good ol' classic reason of picking student project: _turtoring self by using a CuTtInG EdGe TecH while building something "real" with it. To The Moon 🚀🚀🚀!_.
